This app was inspired by a project from my time as a student at the Flatiron School. The modeling was never quite right and I really wanted to do this app but better. It uses a Sinatra API located [here](https://github.com/miShelbyT/phase-3-sinatra-api-petdates). (Eventually this will be replaced with a Flask API but for now this will get the job done.)

The modeling looks like so: Users -< Pets -< PetMeets >- Meetups

Auth will be added shortly.
